The team is $4.9 million below the luxury tax and has a $2.2 million trade exception, per Capsheets.com.\nWith the emergence of Mathurin and Nembhard this season, the Pacers have stockpiled plenty of backcourt talent, meaning competition for minutes should only increase next season. Hield bounced back this season, knocking down 42.5 percent of his 3-point attempts, the best 3-point percentage among qualified players on the team and ninth in the league.\nPlaying again as a primary scoring threat, Hield's scoring averaged jumped to 18.2 points during his first two months in Indiana."
